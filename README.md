# Identity & Access Management Lifecycle (IAM) Project

## Objective
Demonstrate practical IAM concepts including identity lifecycle management, role-based access control (RBAC), and access governance.

## Scope
This project focuses on how identities are created, modified, and removed, and how access is granted and reviewed to enforce least privilege.

## Identity Lifecycle
- Joiner: New user onboarding and initial access assignment
- Mover: Role or department changes and access adjustments
- Leaver: Deprovisioning and access removal

## Access Control Model
- RBAC used to map job roles to permissions
- Group-based access aligned to business functions
- Emphasis on least privilege and auditability

## Access Reviews
Included examples of:
- Periodic access review checklists
- High-risk access identification
- Privileged account review considerations

## Risks Addressed
- Privilege creep
- Orphaned accounts
- Excessive or unreviewed access

## Why This Matters
IAM is foundational to cybersecurity. Most security incidents involve identity misuse, making lifecycle controls and access governance critical to both SOC and IAM teams.
