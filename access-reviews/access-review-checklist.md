# Access Review Checklist

## Objective
Provide a structured approach for reviewing user access to ensure continued alignment with job responsibilities.

## Review Frequency
- Standard users: Quarterly
- Privileged users: Monthly or more frequently

## Review Steps
- Verify user role and employment status
- Review group memberships and permissions
- Identify excessive or unused access
- Confirm business justification for privileged access
- Document findings and actions taken

## Red Flags
- Users with access outside their job function
- Privileged access without documented approval
- Inactive accounts with active permissions

## Outcome
- Approve continued access
- Modify access to align with least privilege
- Revoke unnecessary or unauthorized access

## Why This Matters
Regular access reviews reduce risk from privilege creep and help meet audit and compliance requirements.
