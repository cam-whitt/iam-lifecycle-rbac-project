# Identity Lifecycle: Joiner, Mover, Leaver

## Joiner (New User Onboarding)
### Actions
- Create user account
- Assign baseline role-based access
- Enroll user in required security groups
- Enforce initial security controls (MFA, password policy)

### Risks
- Overprovisioning access
- Missing required approvals

---

## Mover (Role or Department Change)
### Actions
- Review existing access
- Remove access no longer required
- Assign new role-based permissions
- Document access changes

### Risks
- Privilege creep
- Conflicting permissions

---

## Leaver (Offboarding)
### Actions
- Disable user account immediately
- Remove group memberships
- Revoke privileged access
- Archive or transfer ownership of data

### Risks
- Orphaned accounts
- Unauthorized access post-termination

## Why This Matters
Consistent identity lifecycle management reduces the risk of unauthorized access and ensures access aligns with current job responsibilities.
